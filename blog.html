          Discuss the scope of var, let, and const

          <p>
            In JavaScript, var variables have function scope, let and const
            variables have block scope, and all three are hoisted to some
            extent. var variables can be accessed throughout the function or
            file where they are declared, potentially leading to unintended
            behavior. let and const variables are limited to the nearest
            enclosing block, promoting code isolation and reducing variable
            conflicts. While let variables can be reassigned within their scope,
            const variables are constant but still allow modifications to object
            properties or array elements. Modern JavaScript development favors
            let and const over var due to their block scoping and improved code
            predictability.

          <p>
            null is used to explicitly indicate the absence of a value or as a
            deliberate placeholder for uninitialized variables, offering a clear
            representation of missing data. undefined is the default value for
            variables and function parameters when no value is assigned,
            signifying that a value hasn't been provided or a property hasn't
            been initialized yet.

          What do you mean by REST API?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming
            Interface) is a standardized way for software applications to
            communicate with each other over the internet. It follows a set of
            principles, using HTTP methods like GET (retrieve data), POST
            (create data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (remove data) to
            interact with resources, typically in JSON or XML format. REST APIs
            are commonly used for web and mobile app development to access and
            manipulate data on remote servers. They are known for their
            simplicity, scalability, and flexibility in designing web services.
